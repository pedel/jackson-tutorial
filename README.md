Intruduction
============
I have been using Jackson framework for sometime for parsing JSON data. It is an awesome framework. This page is to share what I have learned while using the framework and what I consider to be an idiomatic way of parsing JSON data using Jackson. Please note that the most authoritative information can be found at the [Jackson project page](http://jackson.codehaus.org/).
